custom.js
===============

My custom Jupyter shortcuts. ðŸ˜Š

### How to use:

(1) While a cell is selected (blue outline in Command Mode, green outline in Edit Mode), Use Ctrl+E to open the cell in Sublime. (Save and close the file when you're done editing.)

(2) Then use Ctrl+Shift+E to update the cell with the contents saved in Sublime. (Ctrl+Shift+E will do nothing if the cell has never been edited in Sublime.)

(3) Ctrl+O will copy the output of a cell. Works in Edit or Command mode.

- Only tested on Chrome. Firefox may complain about permission issues because this shortcut uses `document.execCommand('cut')` to implement copying.


### Additional side things:

Starting at line 151 in the file `custom.js` I added the following lines:

	Edit.add_shortcut('ctrl-b', 'jupyter-notebook:run-cell');
	Command.add_shortcut('ctrl-b', 'jupyter-notebook:run-cell');
	Edit.remove_shortcut('ctrl-enter');
	Edit.add_shortcut('alt-w', 'jupyter-notebook:enter-command-mode');
	Command.add_shortcut('alt-w', 'jupyter-notebook:enter-edit-mode');

Basically:

- Ctrl+B to run the cell (edit or command mode)

- Unbind Ctrl+Enter while in edit mode

- Alt+W to enter and exit edit mode.

If you don't want one of them just delete the line, and nothing bad will happen.
